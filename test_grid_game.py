        [0, 1I have created the solution script Hospital/grid_game.py implementing the described grid game logic with BFS.

Next, I will create the test file Hospital/test_grid_game.py to verify the solution against the provided examples and some additional cases. After that, I will run the tests to confirm correctness. Proceeding with creating the test file now.
